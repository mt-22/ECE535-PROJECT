## VLM-based Smart Baby Monitoring

### *Motivation*
Current baby monitors typically have limited functionality when it comes to alerting parents of events. Some may sense when the baby moves or makes a sound, but not the exact kind of movement or sound. 
Using Visual Language Models we can output precise information about what the baby is doing in a quick and easy to digest fashion, for example a line of text sent to the parents phone as a notificaiton.
